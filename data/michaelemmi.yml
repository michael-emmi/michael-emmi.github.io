about: >

  <p>Michael received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from UCLA in 2010 and
  joined the IMDEA Software Institute in 2013, following a postdoc fellowship
  at the Université Paris Diderot awarded by La Fondation Sciences
  Mathématiques de Paris. Prior to all that, Michael completed his
  undergraduate studies at Binghamton University (SUNY). He has been a teaching
  assistant for undergraduate courses at UCLA and Université Paris Diderot, and
  has held internships at Microsoft Research, NASA Ames Research Center, and
  IBM.</p>

  <p>Michael’s research enables the construction of reliable software by
  developing the foundations for effective programming abstractions and
  informative program analysis tools. Integrating technological trends with
  knowledge from several research communities spanning automata theory,
  programming languages, and distributed systems, his contributions include
  establishing the theoretical limits of program analysis, devising tractable
  approximations for intractable analysis problems, and building effective
  analysis tools.</p>
