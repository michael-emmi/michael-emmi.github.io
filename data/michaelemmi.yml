about: >
  <p>Michael received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of
  California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2010. Michael joined the IMDEA Software
  Institute in September 2013, following a post-doc at the Université Paris
  Diderot, on a fellowship awarded by La Fondation Sciences Mathématiques de
  Paris. Prior to receiving his doctorate, Michael completed his undergraduate
  studies at the University of Binghamton, of the State University of New York
  (SUNY). He has been a teaching assistant for undergraduate courses at UCLA
  and Université Paris Diderot, and has held internships at Microsoft Research,
  NASA Ames Research Center, and IBM.</p>

  <p>Michael is primarily interested in developing formal techniques to foster the
  construction of reliable software systems. Specifically, Michael has
  developed formal models to support the analysis of reactive, parallel, and
  distributed software systems, studied their theoretical properties (i.e.,
  decidability, complexity), and developed exploration techniques to quickly
  discover faulty behavior in, or prove correctness of, such systems. Besides
  being the/a principal author of many noteworthy scientific publications (see
  the Publications list below), Michael is a lead developer of some software
  verification tools (see the Software list below).</p>
